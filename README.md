Steve Veldman - 5/22/2024

Welcome to the repository for my spring 2024 machine learning final for the University of Chicago Masters in Applied Data Science program.

The files in this repository include a slide deck outlining the background, use case, methodologies, and resutls of this effort. You will also find a python notebook with code for data processing, model training, and model evaluation, as well as files containing the saved model weights for the two final models discussed, and images of each model's architecture.

The dataset used can be found here:
